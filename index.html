      <p>Today, obesity is one of the most common epidemic which is a medical
        condition characterized by excessive body fat accumulation. It is a complex issue influenced by genetic, 
        environmental, and behavioral factors. Obesity significantly increases the risk of various health complications, 
        including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mental health disorders. According to the World Health Organization, 
        the percentage of adults 18 years of age and older living with obesity more than doubled from 7% to 16%. As of 
        2022 about 1 in 8 people worldwide show that they live with obesity, with the number of adults with obesity having more 
        than doubled since 1990, and adolescent obesity quadrupling. Around 2.5 billion adults were overweight, and among them, 
        890 million were obese. It is expected that the global costs of overweight and obesity is predicted to reach $3 trillion 
        per year by 2030 and more than $18 trillion by 2060 if no effective measures are taken.</p>

      <p>Obesity rates are rising not only in high-income countries but also fast in low and middle-income countries, affecting 
        various socio-economic groups. Projections estimate that by 2025, about 2.7 billion adults could be living with overweight 
        or obesity, and by 2030, the number of people with obesity globally could double compared to 2010, surpassing 1 billion adults.
        A way one can measure if individuals have a healthy weight is by determining their Body Mass Index (BMI) which is a simple 
        screening tool that estimates body fat by using your weight and height, categorizing adults as underweight, normal weight, 
        overweight, or obese, and helping assess potential health risks like heart disease or diabetes, though it doesn't directly 
        measure body fat and has limitations for muscle mass.</p>

      <iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-adults-defined-as-obese?tab=line" 
      loading="lazy" 
      class="chart-frame"
      allow="web-share; clipboard-write"></iframe>

      <p>Generally, the BMI range for having a healthy weight is typically between 18.5 to 24.9. However if the individuals are from a different 
        ethnic groups, the healthy weight range may vary. For example, in some Asian populations, a BMI of 23 is considered the threshold for overweight 
        and obesity. According to a study published on the ethnic differences in relation between BMI and percentage body fat in the <i>British 
        Journal of Nutrition</i>, this is mainly due to a correlation between BMI and %BF where Asian children had a greater %BF than Caucasian children 
        at any given BMI, suggesting that the former may be at higher risk of developing obesity-related health conditions at lower BMI values  suggesting 
        that the differences in BMI–%BF relationship should be considered when BMI is used as a screening tool for obesity in epidemiologic studies and 
        in clinical settings. Additionally, there are patterns of greater amount of fat stored around internal organs relative to fat under the skin; 
        which is more metabolically harmful & poses higher health risks among Asian & middle-eastern populations.</p>

      <p>While the causes of obesity are usually well known ranging from lack of physical activity, poor dietary habits and genetic predispositions there
        are additional factors one that is usually overlooked which is the psychological factors that contribute to obesity. Psychological factors such as 
        stress, emotional eating, and depression can significantly influence eating behaviors and weight gain. These factors often interact with lifestyle 
        and genetic predispositions, making obesity a multifaceted health challenge. Another being the environment an individual places themselves, could 
        play an effect in eating unhealthy including parts where one lives & works. A person’s residence, workplace, restaurants around an individual and 
        the amount of green space you have could be contributors. Studies have shown that access to sidewalks and green spaces can help people be more 
        physically active, and grocery stores and farmers markets can help people eat healthier. On the other hand, people living in neighborhoods with 
        more fast-food restaurants and inaccessible or no sidewalks or bike paths are more likely to be overweight or obese.
      </p>

      <p>While trying to understand the causes and consequences of obesity, I was curious as to how did obesity get classified as a disease across the 
        globe? How did it start to expand and what was its source of orgin? Like how health professionals were able to track the origin source of the 
        COVID-19 virus. When did this become a health crisis? Turns out it all began in the second half of the 19th century. Back then people would not 
        have a three-meal diet that we currently follow today. Whenever, there was a requirement or urge, people used to eat accordingly. This was changed 
      later on. As the industrial revolution was in full swing in this time frame and industrialization was expanding on a large scale, people began to 
      faint during working hours and not having the required energy to carry out their daily tasks.</p>

      <p>To counter this issue, factory owners and employers started to provide their workers with scheduled meal breaks. This led to the establishment 
        of the three-meal-a-day routine that we follow today. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner became the standard eating pattern. This change introduced in eating habits 
        was driven by the need to maintain productivity and energy levels during long working hours in factories. Over time, this routine became ingrained 
        in society and is now a common practice worldwide. To add to the challenge, in the first half of the 20th century many the breakfast cereal makers 
        like Kellogg’s and Post introduced breakfast norms marketing as “breakfast being the essential meal of the day” and slogans such as “feed yourself 
        right, or you’ll fail”. This marketing strategy further solidified the three-meal-a-day routine in popular culture & began inflating obesity as a 
        multifaceted health issue.</p>

      <p>What proved as a catalyst for the obesity epidemic took place in the 1960 where the Sugar Research Foundation (SRF) approved a study called 
        ‘Project 226’ which was a covertly funded literature review initiated by the SRF to counter studies linking sugar consumption to coronary heart 
        disease (CHD) conducted by Harvard scientists. It produced a two-part article, "Dietary Fats, Carbohydrates and Atherosclerotic Disease," 
        published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967. The review downplayed sugar evidence, emphasized saturated fats and cholesterol as 
        primary CHD causes, and omitted conflicting studies-shaping low-fat dietary guidelines for decades. This study later helped in forming the 1980 
        Dietary Guidelines for Americans later evolving into the food pyramid proposing to have a high grain intake in an individual’s diet and having 
        fats as the least essential nutrient. Later revelations from the 2016 archival analysis exposed SRF's influence in 1992.</p>

      <p>Addressing the obesity crisis requires a comprehensive approach that includes promoting healthy eating habits, increasing physical activity,
        and implementing public health policies that support healthier environments. Education and awareness campaigns can also play a crucial role in 
        helping individuals make informed choices about their health. Additionally, addressing psychological factors and providing support for mental 
        health can be essential components of obesity prevention and treatment strategies. The first step we can take would be to ensuring that we have 
        well balanced diet which should mainly consist of proteins, fats in major proportion & a small chunk within grains and emphasizing fruits, 
        vegetables, whole grains, and portion control. This month (7th January 2026), secretary of Health & Human Services Robert F. Kennedy unveiled 
        a new food pyramid and dietary guidelines that call for "prioritizing high-quality protein, healthy fats, fruits, vegetables and whole grains" 
        while avoiding highly processed foods and refined carbohydrates.</p>

pyramid.</i></p>
      
      <p>Another way would be to support local improvements like better sidewalks, bike routes, and affordable healthy foods through vouchers or farm 
        programs. Engage in school-based interventions, worksite wellness, and mass media campaigns to promote nutrition and activity. Advocate for policies 
        expanding low-calorie food availability and nutritional labeling in public spaces. In addition, community members could also provide social 
        support interventions like group walks or exercise classes, which increase activity time by a median of 44%. Host events such as family 5Ks or 
        activity breaks at fairs, and partner for extended gym hours or free classes. Fund programs like 'Communities Putting Prevention to Work for 
        environmental changes' making healthy living easier</p>
