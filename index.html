        Today, obesity is one of the most common global epidemics. It is a medical condition defined by having too much body fat. 
        Obesity is a complex issue influenced by genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors. It greatly increases the risk of 
        many health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and mental health disorders.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to the World Health Organization, the percentage of adults aged 18 and older living with obesity more than doubled 
        from 7% to 16%. As of 2022, about 1 in 8 people worldwide live with obesity. The number of adults with obesity has more than 
        doubled since 1990, and obesity among adolescents has quadrupled. Around 2.5 billion adults were overweight, and among them, 
        890 million were obese. If no effective action is taken, global costs related to overweight and obesity are expected to reach 
        $3 trillion per year by 2030 and more than $18 trillion by 2060.</p>

      allow="web-share; clipboard-write"></iframe>

      <p>
        Obesity rates are rising not only in high-income countries but also rapidly in low- and middle-income countries. It affects people 
        across many socio-economic groups. Projections estimate that by 2025, about 2.7 billion adults could be living with overweight or 
        obesity. By 2030, the number of people with obesity worldwide could double compared to 2010, surpassing 1 billion adults.
      </p>

      <p>
        One common way to check whether someone has a healthy weight is by using Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a simple screening tool that uses a 
        person’s weight and height to estimate body fat. It groups adults into categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. 
        BMI helps assess possible health risks like heart disease and diabetes. However, BMI does not directly measure body fat and may not be accurate 
        for people with high muscle mass.
      </p>

      <p>
        In general, a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered a healthy weight range. However, healthy ranges can vary among different ethnic groups. For 
        example, in some Asian populations, a BMI of 23 is already considered the threshold for overweight or obesity. A study published in the British 
        Journal of Nutrition found ethnic differences in the relationship between BMI and body fat percentage (%BF). The study showed that Asian children 
        had a higher %BF than Caucasian children at the same BMI. This means Asian children may face higher risks of obesity-related health problems at 
        lower BMI values. These differences should be considered when BMI is used as a screening tool in research and healthcare settings. In addition, 
        some populations, including Asian and Middle Eastern groups, tend to store more fat around internal organs rather than under the skin. This type 
        of fat is more harmful to health.
      </p>

      <p>
        The causes of obesity are often described as lack of physical activity, poor diet, and genetic predisposition. However, other factors are often overlooked, 
        especially psychological ones. Stress, emotional eating, and depression can strongly affect eating habits and lead to weight gain. These factors interact 
        with lifestyle and genetics, making obesity a complex health challenge.

      <p>
        The environment where a person lives also plays an important role. Where someone lives, works, and shops can influence eating habits and physical activity levels. 
        Access to sidewalks, parks, and green spaces can make it easier to stay active. Having grocery stores and farmers’ markets nearby can help people make healthier 
        food choices. On the other hand, neighborhoods with many fast-food restaurants and few safe places to walk or bike are linked to higher rates of overweight and obesity.
      </p>

      <p>
        While learning about the causes and effects of obesity, I became curious about how obesity came to be classified as a disease worldwide. How did it spread, and where did it begin, 
        similar to how scientists traced the origin of the COVID-19 virus? When did it become a global health crisis? Its roots go back to the second half of the 19th century. At that time, 
        people did not follow the three-meal-a-day pattern that is common today. Instead, they ate whenever they felt hungry. This changed during the Industrial Revolution, when large-scale 
        industrial work became common. Many factory workers fainted or lacked the energy to complete long workdays. To solve this, employers began giving workers scheduled meal breaks. 
        This led to the routine of eating three meals a day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The goal was to keep workers energized during long factory hours. Over time, this pattern became a 
        social norm and spread worldwide.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the early 20th century, breakfast cereal companies strengthened this habit through advertising. Campaigns promoted messages like “breakfast is the most important meal of the day” 
        and “feed yourself right, or you’ll fail.” These marketing efforts helped solidify the three-meal routine in popular culture and contributed to the growing complexity of obesity 
        as a health issue.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Another major turning point occurred in the 1960s. The Sugar Research Foundation (SRF) funded a secret project called “Project 226.” This was a literature review designed to challenge 
        research linking sugar consumption to coronary heart disease (CHD). Conducted by Harvard scientists, the project resulted in a two-part article titled “Dietary Fats, Carbohydrates and 
        Atherosclerotic Disease,” published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967.
      </p>

      <p>
        The review minimized evidence about sugar’s role in heart disease and instead highlighted saturated fats and cholesterol as the main causes. It also left out studies that did not 
        support its conclusions. These findings influenced low-fat dietary guidelines for decades. The study later helped shape the 1980 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which led to the 
        food pyramid that emphasized high grain intake and labeled fats as the least important nutrient. In 2016, an archival analysis revealed the SRF’s role in influencing this research, 
        which had remained hidden since 1992.
      </p>

      <p>
        Addressing the obesity crisis requires a broad and balanced approach. This includes promoting healthy eating habits, encouraging physical activity, and creating public health policies 
        that support healthier environments. Education and awareness campaigns can help people make informed decisions about their health. It is also important to address psychological factors 
        and provide mental health support as part of obesity prevention and treatment.
      </p>

      <p>
        A practical first step is aiming for a balanced diet. This may include higher proportions of proteins and healthy fats, smaller portions of grains, and a strong focus on fruits, 
        vegetables, whole grains, and portion control. On January 7, 2026, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy unveiled a new food pyramid and dietary guidelines. 
        These guidelines recommend prioritizing high-quality protein, healthy fats, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while limiting highly processed foods and refined carbohydrates.

      </p>

      <p>
        Other solutions include improving local environments by adding sidewalks, bike lanes, and better access to affordable healthy foods through vouchers or farm programs. Schools, 
        workplaces, and media campaigns can promote better nutrition and physical activity. Public policies can also support clearer nutrition labeling and make low-calorie foods more
         available.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Community support also makes a difference. Group activities like walking clubs or exercise classes can increase physical activity time by a median of 44%. Communities can host 
        events such as family 5K runs or activity breaks at local fairs. Partnering with local organizations to extend gym hours or offer free classes can also help. Programs like 
        “Communities Putting Prevention to Work” support environmental changes that make healthy living easier for everyone.
