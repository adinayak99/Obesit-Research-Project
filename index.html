      <p>Today, obesity is one of the most common epidemics and is a medical condition characterized by excessive body fat accumulation. 
        It is a complex issue influenced by genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors. Obesity significantly increases the risk of 
        various health complications card ranging from cardiovascular disease, diabetes to mental health disorders. According to the World 
        Health Organization, the percentage of adults 18 years of age and older living with obesity more than doubled from 7% to 16%. 
        As of 2022, about 1 in 8 people worldwide live with obesity, with the number of adults with obesity having more than doubled 
        since 1990, and adolescent obesity quadrupling. Around 2.5 billion adults were overweight, and among them, 890 million were obese.
        It is expected that the global costs of overweight and obesity will reach $3 trillion per year by 2030 and more than $18 trillion
        by 2060 if no effective measures are taken.</p>

      <p>Obesity rates are rising not only in high-income countries but also rapidly in low- and middle-income countries, affecting 
        various socio-economic groups. Projections estimate that by 2025, about 2.7 billion adults could be living with overweight 
        or obesity, and by 2030, the number of people with obesity globally could double compared to 2010, surpassing 1 billion adults.
        One way to measure whether individuals have a healthy weight is by determining their Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a simple 
        screening tool that estimates body fat by using weight and height, categorizing adults as underweight, normal weight, 
        overweight, or obese, and helping assess potential health risks like heart disease or diabetes, though it doesn't directly 
        measure body fat and has limitations for those with high muscle mass.</p>

      <iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-adults-defined-as-obese?tab=line" 
      loading="lazy" 
      class="chart-frame"
      allow="web-share; clipboard-write"></iframe>

      <p>
        Generally, the BMI range for a healthy weight is typically between 18.5 and 24.9. However, for individuals from different 
        ethnic groups, the healthy weight range may vary. For example, in some Asian populations, a BMI of 23 is considered the threshold 
        for overweight and obesity. According to a study published in the British Journal of Nutrition on ethnic differences in the relation between BMI and 
        percentage body fat, this is mainly due to a correlation between BMI and body fat percentage (%BF), where Asian children had a greater 
        %BF than Caucasian children at any given BMI. This suggests that Asian children may be at higher risk of developing obesity-related 
        health conditions at lower BMI values, indicating that differences in the BMI – %BF relationship should be considered when BMI is used as 
        a screening tool for obesity in epidemiologic studies and clinical settings. Additionally, there are patterns of greater amounts of fat 
        stored around internal organs relative to fat under the skin, which is more metabolically harmful and poses higher health risks among 
        Asian and Middle Eastern populations.</p>

      <p>
        While the causes of obesity are usually well known; ranging from lack of physical activity and poor dietary habits to genetic 
        predispositions - there are additional factors that are often overlooked, particularly psychological factors that contribute to 
        obesity such as stress, emotional eating, and depression can significantly influence eating behaviors and 
        weight gain. These factors often interact with lifestyle and genetic predispositions, making obesity a multifaceted health 
        challenge. Another factor is the environment in which an individual lives, which can affect unhealthy eating patterns, including 
        where one lives and works. A person's residence, workplace, nearby restaurants, and the amount of green space available could be 
        contributors. Studies have shown that access to sidewalks and green spaces can help people be more physically active, and grocery 
        stores and farmers markets can help people eat healthier. On the other hand, people living in neighborhoods with more fast-food 
        restaurants and inaccessible or no sidewalks or bike paths are more likely to be overweight or obese.
      </p>

      <p>
        While trying to understand the causes and consequences of obesity, I was curious about <i>how obesity became to be classified as a 
        disease worldwide.</i> How did it start to expand, and what was its source of origin, similar to how health professionals were able to 
        track the origin of the COVID-19 virus? When did this become a health crisis? It turns out it all began in the second half of the 
        19th century. Back then, people did not follow the three-meal diet that we follow today. Whenever there was a need or urge, people 
        would eat accordingly. This changed later on. As the Industrial Revolution was in full swing during this time frame and 
        industrialization was expanding on a large scale, wokers on-site began to faint during working hours and lacked the required energy to 
        carry out their daily tasks. To address this issue, factory owners and employers started providing their workers with scheduled 
        meal breaks. This led to the establishment of the three-meal-a-day routine that we follow today. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner 
        became the standard eating pattern. This change in eating habits was driven by the need to maintain energy levels during long 
        working hours in factories. Over time, this routine became ingrained in society and is now a common practice worldwide. To add to 
        the challenge; in the first half of the 20th century, many breakfast cereal makers introduced breakfast norms through marketing 
        campaigns claiming "breakfast is the most essential meal of the day" and slogans such as "feed yourself right, or you'll fail." 
        This marketing strategy further solidified the three-meal-a-day routine in popular culture and began inflating obesity as a 
        multifaceted health issue.
      </p>

      <p>
        What proved to be a catalyst for the obesity epidemic took place in the 1960s when the Sugar Research Foundation (SRF) approved a 
        study called 'Project 226,' which was a covertly funded literature review initiated by the SRF to counter studies linking sugar 
        consumption to coronary heart disease (CHD), conducted by Harvard scientists. It produced a two-part article, "Dietary Fats, 
        Carbohydrates and Atherosclerotic Disease," published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967. The review downplayed 
        evidence about sugar, emphasized saturated fats and cholesterol as primary CHD causes, and omitted conflicting studies, shaping 
        low-fat dietary guidelines for decades. This study later helped form the 1980 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which evolved 
        into the food pyramid proposing high grain intake in an individual's diet and designating fats as the least essential 
        nutrient. Further revelations from a 2016 archival analysis exposed the SRF's influence, which had remained discrete since 1992.

        Addressing the obesity crisis requires a comprehensive approach that includes promoting healthy eating habits, increasing physical 
        activity,and implementing public health policies that support healthier environments. Education and awareness campaigns can also 
        play a crucial role in helping individuals make informed choices about their health. Additionally, addressing psychological 
        factors and providing support for mental health can be essential components of obesity prevention and treatment strategies. The 
        first step we can take would be to ensure that we have a well-balanced diet, which should mainly consist of proteins and fats in 
        major proportions and a small portion of grains, while emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and portion control. This 
        month (January 7, 2026), Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy unveiled a new food pyramid and dietary 
        guidelines that call for "prioritizing high-quality protein, healthy fats, fruits, vegetables and whole grains while avoiding 
        highly processed foods and refined carbohydrates.

pyramid.</i></p>
      
      <p>
        Another way would be to support local improvements like better sidewalks, bike routes, and access to affordable healthy foods 
        through vouchers or farm programs. Engage in school-based interventions, worksite wellness programs, and mass media campaigns 
        to promote nutrition and physical activity. Advocate for policies expanding low-calorie food availability and nutritional labeling 
        in public spaces. In addition, community members could also provide social support interventions like group walks or exercise 
        classes, which increase activity time by a median of 44%. Host events such as family 5Ks or activity breaks at fairs, and partner 
        with local organizations for extended gym hours or free classes. Fund programs like 'Communities Putting Prevention to Work' for 
        environmental changes that make healthy living easier.
